CLUE DESIGN IDEAS
    Wanna make the clue buttons big squares and have the clues be displayed within the squares themselves
    - with pictures
        - club logo
        - graphic for position
        - birthday cake -> change to age
        - birthplace -> change to country, display country
        - peak market value -> make cool font   
            - or get rid of idk
    OR
    make them in the style of cards
    or make one card for the player and reveal the information

specific functionality/issues
- revealed clues should not display (and the entire clue section) when the guess is correct
- needs to look same in resized windows
- And then I want it to be fixed so thereâ€™s like no scrolling

- nav bar line w difficultySelect
- give up button disabled when player guess is correct
