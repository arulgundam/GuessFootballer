Wanna make the clue buttons big squares and have the clues be displayed within the squares themselves
- with pictures
    - club logo
    - graphic for position
    - birthday cake -> change to age
    - birthplace -> change to country, display country
    - peak market value -> make cool font   
        - or get rid of idk

And then I want it to be fixed so thereâ€™s like no scrolling
