CLUE DESIGN IDEAS
    Wanna make the clue buttons big squares and have the clues be displayed within the squares themselves
    - with pictures
        - club logo
        - graphic for position
        - birthday cake -> change to age
        - birthplace -> change to country, display country
        - peak market value -> make cool font   
            - or get rid of idk
    OR
    make them in the style of cards
    or make one card for the player and reveal the information

Tailwind CSS Intellisense plug in (in VSCODE)

specific functionality/issues
- revealed clues should not display (and the entire clue section) when the guess is correct
- needs to look same in resized windows
- And then I want it to be fixed so there’s like no scrolling
-   https://tailwindcss.com/docs/overflow#hiding-content-that-overflows
- nav bar line w difficultySelect
- give up button disabled when player guess is correct
- 1. Need to update clues used so that it doesn’t show “5” when clues are revealed, 
- 2. Give up button available when guessing, new game button available when player has been revealed, 
- 3. Fix top part (difficulty/title/navigation)
- guess form above player card
- new game/give up beneath
- club logo should be unblurred when club is revealed, should also be designed differently imo
